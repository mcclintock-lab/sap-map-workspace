`sapmap` takes the areas that a group identifies as important and combines them into a map of `spatial access priorities (SAP)`

![example polygon](docs/img/survey-sap-start-end.png)

This aggregate map is used in area-based planning exercises for identifying where important areas exist and measuring the impact if changes in access are made.

Common questions it can answer include:
```
Which geographic areas are important to the group?  The most important?  The least important?

Is area A of more value to the group than area B?  How much more?

If the use of a given area is changed, will people be impacted?  How much of the groups value is within this area?
```
